Mammoth - massive relative of the elephants. Found in tundras, taigas, and glaciers. 

Their main difference is their fur, which provides a considerable amount of insulation against the cold.

Goods made out of mammoth body parts have a value multiplier of 5.

Shoveltusk - quadruped herbivores found in tundras, taigas and glaciers. They have a single antler and a pair of tusks.

May occasionally be used by certain races as mounts or pack animals. They are somewhat prone to rage and wild ones may attack unprovoked.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tallstrider - flightless birds found in tropical savannas, grasslands, and moist broadleaf forests.

Some races may use them as mounts, and they can be trained as hunting animals.

Hawkstrider - flightless birds similar to the tallstriders, found in all types of forests.

They can be used as mounts, and also trained as war or hunting animals.

Kodo - very large, quadruped reptiles found in the deserts, savannas and grasslands.

They are trainable as war animals, and many races will utilize them as mounts and pack animals.

Raptoryx - small, half-bird half-lizard creatures found in savage tropical biomes.

They hunt vermin and may be brought along as pets by some migrants.

Sea Hag - spirit entities whose physical bodies are composed out of driftwood and seaweeds.

They are mostly found near the coasts. Although non-hostile, they can be difficult to fight if provoked.

They can shriek which causes fear in any nearby creature.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Talbuk - stag-like herbivores found in the grasslands, shrublands and savannas.

They mostly find use as mounts and pack animals.
