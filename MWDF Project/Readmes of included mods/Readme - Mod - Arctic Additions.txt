A arctic-themed mod by Malecus.

Adds creatures, plants and a civilization:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vermin - Aurora Fairy.  
A vermin creature (as all fairies are) that generates light and makes a nice pet for those who like that sort of thing.

Vermin - Snowflake Fairy.  
Another type of verminous fae.  This one has snowflake-patterned wings.  But they're too small to really see in an ASCII image, let alone code, so you'll just have to take my word for it.

Vermin - Lemming.  
I briefly considered creating a kobold-like lemming so that the fortress could get attacked by suicidal little things with the ability to blow themselves up somehow, but went with the actual creature instead.  I reserve the right to add my kobemmings (Lemolds?) at a later date.

Vermin - Hotheaded Borer.  
A small rodent with a heat-producing 'horn' that it uses to melt snow and ward off potential predators.  It's like a living space heater!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monster - Blizzard Harpy.  
Like the conventional harpy, but more owl-ish and comes equipped with a portable snowstorm for fun times.

Creature - Jolly Snowman.  
It's a creature made of snow, so don't expect it to pack much of a punch.  This one has a few problems in that the color for its nose and eyes aren't being used (not sure why), and it isn't leaving a silk hat behind after death (maybe because it's not recognizing the SPIDER_PHANTOM or ITEM_HELM_CAP tokens).

Animal - Mastodon.  
An elephant for the arctic, so you can get traditionally gored without breaking a sweat.

Animal - Woolly Boar.  
The mammoth was too big for you?  Here, take a smaller example that tastes like pork, provides ivory, and can be sheared for wool.

Animal - Woolly Rhinoceros.  
The boar was too small for you?  Fine, here's a medium-sized example from pre-history that should split the difference between easy-mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species - Jotunn.  
Ice giants, if you will.  Their frost breath can immobilize (unless they're in a non-freezing biome, in which case they basically mass spit at everything; think of it as an impromptu wet toga contest).  With the entity part added in, you can have a winter-based trading partner (unless you decide to start a fight, in which case watch out because their size and might makes them pack a punch).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plant - Snowbulb.  
A round plant that fits pleasingly in the palm of most hands.  Naughty children -- or tantruming dwarves -- seem to derive great satisfaction from throwing them at others.

Plant - Icicle.  
A creeping vine that bears a long conical fruit.  Known for growing in and encapsulating the essence of the cold itself.

Grass - Hoarfrost.  
Something for the herbivores to eat in an otherwise barren environment.

Grass - Lichen.  
It's not in any way connected to undead spellcasters.  It's that stuff that grows on rocks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Megabeast - Blizzard Incarnate.  
I wanted a storm that could get inside a fortress, so I made one.  This thing will knock your dwarves unconscious and into their own cage traps (which it avoids, because how can you capture the arctic winds themselves?), then it'll give them frostbite, rotting away their toes, fingers, and noses.  It may also attack your FPS and fill your errorlog with path fail entries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Semi-megabeast - Krampus.  
The evil counterpart to Saint Nicholas.  Except that it's not just one guy, it's a type of monster.
