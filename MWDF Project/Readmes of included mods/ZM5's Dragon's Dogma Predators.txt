Brief descriptions of all Dragon's Dogma predators, by ZM5.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanoids and Undead - all undead creatures have the standard advantages of being undead, i.e no pain, no fear, etc. unless noted otherwise.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gorecyclops - massive, 4 tusked giant, found underground and in evil forests, shrublands and grasslands. Can potentially grow to be the size of a vanilla DF giant (at 300 years).
Has expert in mace skill, is competent in wrestling, striking and fighting, novice in kicking and adequate in dodging.
May sometimes be sold by races with access to evil animals - or used by similar races in sieges.

Eliminator - large, horned humanoid found underground and in evil biomes. Has an armoured head covered with a layer of steel (simulating a helmet).
Doesn't feel fear or pain. Has accomplished hammer skill, is competent in wrestling, kicking and striking, skilled in fighting, and adequate in dodging.
As with the Gorecyclopes, it can be sold by races with access to evil animals or used by said races in sieges.

Cave Brute (Ogres from DD) - large humanoid that can be found underground, or in the shrublands, grasslands or savannas at night. Cannot be stunned.
Proficient in striking, kicking, wrestling, biting and fighting - will also occasionally be "flushed red with anger", temporarily increasing its strength
and agility, while also making it more prone to rage. Not tamable.

All Saurian variants come in two different sizes - regular and giant - giants are twice as big as the normal caste, but also more rare.

Saurian - lizard-like humanoid found in temperate lakes, rivers and wetlands. They can spit a glob of poison which can cause necrosis on contact.

Sulfur Saurian - found in tropical lakes, rivers and wetlands. Their spit doesn't cause necrosis, but instead reduces the speed of the affected creature to 70%.

Geo Saurian - found in the mountains and underground. Their hides are tougher and reduce the force of oncoming attacks by 1/3. They can spit magma, similar to magma crabs.

Saurian Sage - found underground and in savage lakes, rivers and wetlands. They have two lightning spells - one shoots liquid lightning that can cause paralysis and pain,
the other shoots a ball of lightning that can cause damage on impact. Its spit causes dizziness and makes creatures more vulnerable to their ball lightning.

Pyre Saurian - found deep underground and in savage rocky wastelands. Immune to fire, cannot be blinded, and has a higher body temperature.
Can spit a glob of magma, or breathe a stream of fire. Unlike other Saurians, it does not have a giant version.

Feral Goblin (DD Goblins) - come in several different variations. Considered a kobold-like race that dwells in caves, albeit tougher - can potentially come to harass
your fortress or steal goods. 

Standard feral goblins are slightly bigger than regular kobolds, although are still just as cowardly.

Black Goblins (the Hobgoblin variety) are bigger than the feral goblins and are more prone to rage than other variants.

Grimgoblins are bigger still than the Black Goblins - they also feel no fear, though they aren't as prone to rage.

Greater Goblins are the largest variety, being bigger than humans. They likewise feel no fear.

Feral Goblin Shamans are the most rare variety - while they're a similar size to the regular feral goblins, they possess several spells.
They can shoot a ball of lightning that causes damage on impact, shoot liquid frost or liquid lightning, both of which can cause syndromes.
They also can cast a protective spell over their allies, which temporarily increases their toughness and prevents them from feeling fear.

Poisoned Undead - large, humanoid undead, found underground and in evil biomes. 
They can throw up bile that causes a spatter on the ground - contact with it can cause necrosis and nausea.

Mountain Harpy (standard Harpy from DD) - humanoid flier, found in the mountains. Their song can induce drowsiness.

Snow Harpy - found in taigas and temperate, coniferous forests. Aside from the drowsiness-inducing song, they can also breathe a cloud of frost.

Blood Hag (Succubus from DD) - found in evil temperate forests and taigas. 
They can suck blood with their bites, and their song can inflict a curse which makes combat rolls worse for those who hear it.

Stone Fiend (Gargoyle from DD) - flier found in savage mountains and temperate forests. 
They have a stone-like hide that makes them difficult to damage. Additionally, they have a stinger - its stabs can potentially turn an affected creature into a stone statue.

Blood Fiend (Strigoi from DD:DA) - larger variant of the stone fiend, found underground and in evil deserts and temperate forests.
Its much larger than its cousin, although it lacks the petrifying sting attack - instead its stings merely drain blood.

Wailing Dead (Banshee from DD:DA) - humanoid undead found underground and in evil biomes.
They can let loose a bloodcurdling scream that causes short-term unconsciouss - aside from that they're unremarkable, combat-wise.

Giant Undead - humanoid undead, nearly twice as large as a regular human. Found underground and in evil biomes.
They will attempt to topple doors and any buildings.

Skeleton Brute - skeletal undead, nearly four times as large as a regular human. Found further underground and in evil biomes.
As with the Giant Undead, they will attempt to topple any constructions. Has competent fighting and sword skill.

Gray Cyclops (standard cyclops from DD) - giant with two tusks found in savage grasslands, forests, shrublands, and underground.
Can be bought from many races - will occasionally be used as mounts or war beasts.
Has competent wrestling and wrestling, adequate kicking, skilled fighting, and proficient mace skill.

Beasts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Garm - wolf-like beast found underground and in evil tundras, taigas, temperate forests and temperate shrublands.
They can breathe a gas that can induce temporary blindness.
Races with access to evil animals may sell them. Siegers with access to evil animals will use them as mounts or war animals.

Vile Eye - small, flying eyeball with a pair of fanged mouth-like eyelids. They don't feel fear or pain, and cannot be stunned.
They have access to three projectile spells - either shooting a fireball, a glob of liquid lightning or a glob of liquid frost.
Additionally they also have a Gaze attack that can cause a number of varying syndromes - though their version is weaker than that of their
megabeast cousins.

Hellhound - wolf-like beast found in evil forests, grasslands, shrublands and savannas. They can spit a ball of fire, and their bites
will cause a burst of flames to erupt.

Direwolf - large, white wolves - can be found in temperate coniferous forests and taigas. 
Larger than most dwarves - their body materials have a x3 value multiplier.

Warg - wolf-like creature found in evil temperate forests, grasslands, shrublands and savannas.
They have a poisonous bite that can cause necrosis and short-term nausea.

Gorechimera - a large and powerful but rare beast that can be found in evil forests, taigas, mountains, shrublands, savannas and grasslands.
They possess several abilities, though they can be disabled if its heads are decapitated.
The Goat head can shoot bolts of lightning at up to 3 targets, cast a Torpor spell, and cast a sleep spell.
The Snake head can spray a stream of acid - additionally, bites from it can inject a poison that can cause nausea, dizziness, swelling, necrosis, and oozing.
The Lion head can roar, terrifying nearby enemies.
The Gorechimeras body material has a x11 value modifier.

Lesser Chimera (standard DD Chimera) - large, rare beast found in savage forests, mountains, grasslands, savannas and shrublands.
Similar to the Gorechimera, albeit weaker - its poison only causes necrosis and nausea, its spray attack only sprays poison instead of acid.
It can only direct a lightning bolt at 1 target at a time - it still has a Sleep spell, but it lacks the Torpor spell.
