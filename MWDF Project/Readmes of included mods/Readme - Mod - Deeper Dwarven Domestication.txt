This mod adds 10 new pets to the dwarven civiliation. They have an underground/cave theme and each one a unique purpose.


--------------------------------------------
Boulder Crab   
--------------------------------------------
A large subterranean crustacean that can be found wandering caverns in search of food.  It is often domesticated by dwarves and harvested for its delicious meat and useful shellstone.  Those that live to a venerable age can grow truly massive in size.

Uses: meat, eggs, carapace (counts as bone), flux stone (when butchered)

Special: When butchered, boulder crabs yield a “shellstone”.   This is a boulder of flux stone with a light blue color.


--------------------------------------------
Dewbeetle   
--------------------------------------------
A large docile insect that can be found roaming in the less hospitable regions of the world.  It is often domesticated to collect the sweet secretions stored in small pods on its abdomen.  This honeydew can be brewed into a tasty beverage.
Uses: eggs, chitin (counts as bone), milkable for honeydew (brewable into beetlemead)

Special: Milking dewbeetles produces a unit of honeydew which your dwarves can eat, cook, or brew into mead.


--------------------------------------------
Shaggy Badgerdog   
--------------------------------------------
A medium-sized mammalian carnivore with large digging claws and long striped fur.  It is equally at home above or below ground and is renowned for its fierce protective nature.  The thick shaggy fur of this creature can be spun into soft yarn.
Uses: shearable fur (yarn) twice/year, trainable for war and hunting, enrages during combat

Special: Badgerdogs are likely to enter into rage in combat, making them much more fierce than normal dogs.


--------------------------------------------
Moleweasel   
--------------------------------------------
A fuzzy little borrowing mammal with a long sleek body and short, wide legs.  It is often kept as a pet for its lovable companionship and to hunt small vermin.
Uses: vermin control (high speed), large litters and fast growth makes for abundant butchering

Special: Moleweasels move twice as fast as normal animals, allowing fewer creatures to hunt vermin over a larger area.


--------------------------------------------
Leatherwing Bat   
--------------------------------------------
A blind flying mammal that hunts small vermin.  Its furry little body is dwarfed by enormous leathery wings.  The many folds of skin from these wings can be safely trimmed as a renewable source of leather.
Uses: vermin control, shearable wings 1/season (source for leather)

Special: The wings of these bats can be sheared for skin that your tanners will turn into leather.  Leatherwing bats also hunt vermin.


--------------------------------------------
Bearded Cavernkeet   
--------------------------------------------
A small flightless bird adapted to life climbing and scrabling underground.  Its short feathers closely resemble silky colored hairs, with a thick tuft beneath its chin forming a very dwarfy beard.  This beard is prized by dwarves as a source of wool.
Uses: eggs, shearable beards (yarn) once/year

Special: The beard hair of these birds can be sheared once a year for beardwool, a source of yarn.  Beardwool is worth triple the normal value of yarn.


--------------------------------------------
Cragtooth Boar   
--------------------------------------------
A medium-sized foraging beast native to shallow caves and burrows.  It possesses a large snout and long tusks which it uses to dig and furrow through the earth.  The tusks of these creatures continuously grow to compensate for the wear of usage and can be sheared as a source of ivory.
Uses: milk (cheese), trainable for war, shearable tusks every couple months (tooth/bone)

Special: Cragtooths tusks are worth twice the normal value of ivory/bone and be sheared as a newable source of these materials.


--------------------------------------------
Woolly Mountain Goat  
--------------------------------------------
A large shaggy herbivore native to the high mountains.  It is able to easily navigate steep slopes and narrow ledges in spite of its larger size and hooved feet.  Bigger and sturdier than its smaller goat cousins, this creature is often raised by dwarves for its abundant wool and milk.
Uses: milk (cheese), caravan animal, shearable wool (yarn) every couple months

Special: Can be sheared much more often than normal creatures.


--------------------------------------------
Horned Caveturtle   
--------------------------------------------
A large subterranean reptile with a thick shell and prominent horn.  Suprisingly docile for their size, these beasts are valued for their meat, eggs, shells and tough scaly hide (which forms a strong sturdy leather)
Uses: eggs, shell, scales tan into leather (higher value and stronger leather)

Special: Large clutches of eggs, and scales tan into scaly hide which is twice as valuable as normal leather, and makes a better armor material.


--------------------------------------------
Mountain Tuskox   
--------------------------------------------
A stocky mammalian beast with stout legs and a dark curly mane.  It possesses small curved horns, short tusks, and thickly padded hooves.  These large herbivores can be found browsing on the sparse plants in foothills and lowlands of mountainous country.
Uses: meat, milk (cheese) milkable very often, wagon puller

Special: Can be milked much more often than normal creatures.
