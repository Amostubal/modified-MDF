*Slothful Mind - a creature representing Sloth, a very frail humanoid with a massive head and brain - it can fly around and has powerful magical abilities, including shooting fire, hurling rocks, raising dead bodies as zombies and kicking up waves of dust - however physically it's very weak.
*Unending Gluttony - a creature representing Gluttony - it has a maw on it's stomach and is naturally skilled in biting. It can also throw up, causing several debilitating syndromes.
*Burning Wrath - a creature representing Wrath - it is a very large humanoid that is naturally strong and skilled in melee combat, and can also enter a martial trance, like a dwarf. It also has a very high body temperature, owing to the fact that it has magma for blood.
*Fallen Pride - a creature representing Pride - it is a bat-like humanoid with wings and horns. They can shoot double fireballs and also create a jet of fire. They also can fool civilizations into believing they are deities in worldgen.
*Cockatrice - a quadruped bird monster, somewhat resembling the Griffin - it has a sac on it's throat where it stores it's petrifying gas. Puncturing it disables it's breath attack, although it also releases the gas itself. Petrified victims cannot move and will slowly "drown" (for some reason I can't get it to suffocate normally) before becoming a masterwork stone statue.
*Bronze Dragon - Dragons with bronze scales, they can breathe a cloud lightning which causes burns and can potentially cause paralysis. They also can spit a glob of liquid lightning, which has a similar effect, spit ball lightning which is a regular, blunt projectile, cast Torpor which slows down the target for a period of time and also flap their wings, kicking up dust.
*Blue Dragon - Dragons with blue scales, they breathe clouds of ice which cause blisters and decrease the speed of creatures caught in it. They also spit balls of liquid frost, again having a similar effect, balls of ice which are also blunt projectiles, and can utilize several magic spells, including fireballs, slow (weaker version of torpor) and polymorph (temporarily turns a creature into a sheep). Like other dragons they can also flap their wings.
*Awakened One - a creature based off of Daimon's second from from Dragons Dogma. It's naturally skilled in several types of melee combat, and has very powerful magical abilities. It can cast ice bolt, being able to target up to 8 creatures at once, throw fireballs at up to 4 creatures, cast Torpor on up to 2 different creatures, throw liquid lightning at up to 2 creatures, or cast immolation, which creates a wave of flame radiating out from it, knocking around nearby creatures.
*Cerberus - a massive three-headed canine creature. It bites with all of its heads at once and can breathe a stream of fire in 3 different directions at once.
*Duke of Flies - a centauroid, fly-like creature. It has 8 legs, 6 arms, 8 eyes, 4 wings and 4 ovipositors. It can suck out blood from the wounds it creates either by biting or stabbing with its ovipositor barbs, and also has several magical abilities used by sorcerers and biomancers. Can also raise dead bodies as ghouls.
*Abomination - an undead creature from Warcraft - it has 3 disproportionately sized arms and is naturally skilled in using axes. It's a lair hunter, and can vomit plague ichor and release a disease cloud, both of which cause debilitating syndromes. Considered a semimegabeast unlike the previous creatures.
*Griffin - a quadruped, flying beast - very strong physically, they can bite and scratch off limbs with ease.
*Chimera - a three-headed beast with bat wings and a scorpions tail. The stinger houses a venom that's the same as the giant desert scorpion's neurotoxin, and one of the heads has horns which it can gore with.
*Medusa - a humanoid creature with a snake's tail and the torso of a human female. They are naturally skilled at melee combat, and much moreso at ranged combat and especially bows. They are lair hunters found in labyrinths and shrines, and can petrify enemies with a unique "stare" attack.
*Insatiable Greed - a creature representing Greed - a humanoid quadruped with hooves and 2 horns, resembling a centauroid bull. They can breathe a cloud of golden dust, which has a low chance of turning victims into statues that will inevitably suffocate and turn into valuable masterwork gold statues; aside from that they can also use a Sedation spell which causes dizziness and lowered Strength, Agility and Endurance.
*Gazer - a round creature with a single eye and six fanged tentacles. It possesses several magical attacks, including a gaze that can potentially inflict a large number of debilitating conditions on a target.
*Evil Eye - a weaker variant of the Gazer - they possess more tentacles, a weaker gaze, and weaker spells.
*Gronn - gargantuan, one-eyed humanoids. They can hurl boulders, a strong projectile attack, slam the ground which kicks up dust and knocks back surrounding creatures, and shout, which can cause dizziness in up to 5 enemies at once.
*Magnaron - relatives of the Gronn, they are even bigger, and have a layer of protective stone over their limbs. On top of having the same ground slam and shout as the gronn, they have an improved projectile attack which fires three boulders instead of one (although at a shorter distance) and can use a reverberating pulse to cause pain and dizziness.
*Green Dragon - Dragons with green scales. They breathe acid which can cause bleeding out to occur quickly, and can also use some nature magic.
*Black Dragons - Brutish dragons with black scales. They breathe magma, can shatter the earth which shoots several rocks, and also release a wave of fire.
*Cursed Dragon - Undead dragons with a necrotizing breath. They can cast torpor, and while they have fewer abilities than other types of dragons, due to their undead state they cannot be debilitated by dealing damage to their limbs, and they also have no eyes.

Other creatures
*Plaguebearer - a large zombie found underground and in evil biomes, it can vomit ichor and release a disease cloud, causing syndromes.

*Mossrova - a benevolent, fungal quadruped. They can be milked like cows, and each of their body parts, if ingested, causes a different syndrome - some are entirely harmful (brain, meat, blood), others are hallucinogenics which cause beneficial syndromes at first, but later have a period of harmful symptoms.
*Treant - forest guardians, they are quite aggressive and prone to rage. The wood they are made out of is a lot tougher than regular wood you can get from trees, making them quite difficult opponents.
*Mutant - a creature mutated by one of several types of plants (joy plants, arachblooms, greenthistles, blackweeds, ghostherbs and bluegrass plants - make sure to not gather them unless you want your own citizens to become one of them), they are found in savage tropical biomes and have several different castes: 
>brute mutants, which can walk on both their arms and legs 
>blob mutants, which have no legs and are the biggest type of mutant

*Eliminator - a Minotaur-like creature from Dragon's Dogma, it is a large humanoid with a layer of steel covering its head (supposed to mimic the helmet they have in the game). Like gorecyclopes, civilizations with access to evil or underground creatures can use them as animals - they'll do some labors and can be conscripted into the military. They are naturally skilled in hammers, don't feel fear or pain, serve as mounts and wagon pullers, and can be war trained.

*Feral goblins - multi-caste, small humanoids. They are the tougher equivalent to kobolds - while the standard "feral goblin" and "black goblin" castes are still very small, the grimgoblin and greater goblin castes can pose a bigger challenge. The feral goblin shamans, while also only barely larger than kobolds, can cast spells which makes them a nuisance - including a protective spell which removes fear from their goblin allies and increases toughness trifold.

New interactions (all of them make a creature not require eating, drinking or sleeping, and also prevent them from over-exerting - additionally psychic powers also allow a creature to see without functioning eyes, and the blessing of strength and paladin interactions make a creature no longer feel fear)
*Deities can now turn you into one of the seven deadly sins creatures or a behemoth if you topple a statue in a temple.
*Pyromancer - a fire-related interaction - knowledge of it (by slab or book) allows a creature to cast double fireballs, send forth a jet of fire, cast "flare" which is a massive wave of dragonfire, throw a bolt of magma and also raise bodies of the dead as Firemen.
*Psychic - a scholarship-related interaction - knowledge of it allows a creature to hurl up to 3 rocks at once, kick up dust around itself, mentally crush a creature's lungs, causing death from suffocation (very long cooldown period), use "mind blast" which causes an immediate wave of pain that knocks a creature unconscious, followed by dizziness when they regain consciousness, use "bind limbs" which slows a creature down and makes their limbs numb, and raise the dead as mind-controlled corpses (much weaker zombies)
*Sorcerer - a darkness-related interaction - knowledge of it allows a creature to raise the dead as revenants (zombies without lowered speed, could also talk in the previous version but seems thats not possible now), and also cast a blinding spell, cast "organ failure" which impairs of the function of every organ in the target creature except the lungs and making them nauseous, and "heartbleed" which rots the heart and causes massive bleeding from it.
*Biomancer -a disease-related interaction - knowledge of it allows a creature to raise the dead as plagued zombies (zombies that rot immediately when raised, releasing miasma in the underground), cast "rotting plague" which rots a targets body immediately and causes nausea, "blood boil" which causes swelling and bleeding, as well as making the creature cough up and vomit blood from time to time, and "cripple" which causes blisters, oozing, dizziness and heavily lowering the targets strength, toughness, agility, endurance and overall speed.
*Blessed warrior - a strength-related interaction that can sometimes be gained by toppling statues in temples - raises strength, agility, recuperation and speed. Also allows the creature to slam and ground and use "dust kick" - both kick up a wave of dust, the difference being that the ground slam is undirected and the dust kick is directed. Drinking a blessed warrior's blood can also grant the interaction.
*Archdruid - a nature-related interaction - allows the creature to temporarily transform into a number of different creatures - a grizzly bear, a giant jaguar, an elephant, a giant crow, a giant cave spider, a giant bark scorpion and a behemoth (lasts much shorter than the other transformations). Also allows the creature to raise the dead as treants.
*Paladin - a light-related interaction - raises strength and agility (though not as much as the strength interaction) as well as toughness and recuperation (to a higher amount than the strength interaction) and allows the creature to resurrect the dead (who turn into a pile of meat for 1 tic), cast "holy bolt", which is a strong blunt projectile that can potentially knock back creatures, and cast "Crusader's Might" which temporarily increases the strength, toughness, agility and recuperation of up to 3 other creatures. Drinking a paladin's blood can also grant the interaction.
