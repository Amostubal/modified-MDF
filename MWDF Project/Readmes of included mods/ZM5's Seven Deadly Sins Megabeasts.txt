Brief descriptions of Seven Deadly Sins-based Megabeasts, by ZM5.

All of these may be found both as "wild" megabeasts in lairs, and also as cursed historical figures in various civilized sites.
Every one of the Sin Incarnations can take over civilizations in worldgen.

They have varying site types - all can be found in labyrinths, the second site type is different for each incarnation.
All are lair hunters and will chase you down if you enter their lair.

Cursed Lust - a humanoid covered in tumors, possessing an elongated tongue. From its back sprout six tentacles ending in hands.
Males and females have minor variations in their body plans - both are capable of spurting a fluid that causes contact and ingestion syndromes.

The syndrome caused by the male causes dizziness, blistering, bruising, swelling and eventually necrosis.
The syndrome caused by the female causes dizziness, vomiting blood, coughing up blood, general bleeding, and nausea.

They are competent at biting, talented in wrestling, fighting, and whip skills, and proficient in dodging, kicking and striking.

Additionally, they don't feel fear, pain, cannot be made nauseous, dizzy, or feverish, and do not require eating, sleeping or drinking.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slothful Mind - a flying humanoid with a massively enlarged head, housing an unnaturally large brain. Lacks most internal organs.

Very weak physically, and easily tired out - however they recuperate very quickly.

They have four special abilities that they can use in order to make up for their physical weakness -
casting a stream of fire, hurling heavy rocks at up to 5 targets at once, kicking up a wave of dust that knocks
around nearby creatures, and raising nearby dead bodies as zombie minions.

They don't feel fear or pain, do not require eating, sleeping, drinking or breathing, and cannot be made feverish.
They'll also avoid traps, and are immune to fire.

They are talented in dodging - additionally, they learn skills three times as fast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unending Gluttony - a gargantuan humanoid with a stomach maw and eyes in unusual places.

They have a single eye on top of their head, one inside their stomach, one on their upper body, one on their left hand and
one on their right upper arm.

They are do not feel fear or pain, do not need to breathe or sleep, and cannot be made feverish.

They are capable of biting with either of their maws - both are more powerful than bites from similarly-sized creatures.
 
Additionally, they can throw up orange puke that can cause necrosis, swelling and nausea.

They have expert biting and fighting skills, talented in striking, and competent in dodging.
Out of all Sin Incarnations, they are the largest.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burning Wrath - massive humanoid with magma for blood - second biggest of the Sin Incarnations.

They have a higher innate body temperature, are very easily angered, do not feel fear or pain, do not require sleeping,
drinking or eating, cannot be made feverish, do not need to breathe and may rarely enter a martial trance while in combat. 
They lack most vital organs.

Their only ability is to enrage even further - this temporarily increases their strength and agility and makes them even more
likely to enter a state of rage. Aside from that, they just hit really hard.

They have expert wrestling, fighting, striking and kicking skills.

Due to their high innate combat skills and magma blood, its not recommended to fight them up close, unless there's a water source nearby.
Throwing is highly recommended. Wrestling in particular is ineffective due to their raw strength - additionally, any body part 
the Wrath incarnation holds on to will quickly start melting and bleeding.

After dying, their bodies eventually burn away, leaving nothing behind.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fallen Pride - large, winged, horned humanoid, resembling a bat-like devil.

They are immune to fire damage, are capable of flight, do not feel fear or pain, cannot be made feverish, and do not require
eating, drinking, sleeping or breathing. They also cannot be stunned.

They are capable of throwing fireballs at up to 2 targets, and can also shoot a stream of fire.
Their last unique attack is to taunt a single target - this makes the target more violent and potentially more prone to entering a rage state.

They are competent in dodging, adept in striking and kicking, and experts at fighting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insatiable Greed - winged, flying centauroid with a bull-like head and hooves.

They cannot be made feverish or nauseous, do not feel fear or pain, cannot be stunned, and do not require sleep.

They are covered in a layer of gold, which adds slight protection and slightly more force to their attacks.

They have 3 unique abilities - they can cast a Sedation spell, which causes dizziness and reduces strength, agility and endurance to 50%;
a breath attack which shoots out a cloud of gold powder that can potentially turn those affected by it into golden statues (similar effect as petrifaction),
and also cast a Barrier spell on themselves, which temporarily increases toughness.

They are adept at fighting, biting, wrestling, striking, and kicking.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hateful Envy - a humanoid skeleton, embedded in a covering of green, metamorphic sludge.

They do not feel fear or pain, do not require eating, drinking, sleeping or breathing, are immune to fire and cannot be made nauseous or feverish.

Due to being made of sludge, most of their attacks count as edged - making them highly dangerous up close. 

They only have one special ability, where they toss a chunk of sludge that on contact has a chance of turning the victim into a small, easily-killed ooze.

They are talented at striking and dodging. While they can bleed, it is difficult to hit any vital organs - blunt weapons in particular are ineffective.
The head is the weak spot, having a thinner layer of sludge.
