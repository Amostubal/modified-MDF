Brief descriptions of all Warcraft-based megabeasts, by ZM5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragons - Most dragons are similar in terms of body features - winged quadruped with 2 horns - main difference being in their unique abilities. The only exception is the Drakeadon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Dragon - more or less a tougher version of vanilla DF dragons - capable of flight.
Can also breathe a stream of dragonfire, spit a fireball or a bolt of magma, and flap their wings to kick up a cloud of dust.

Bronze Dragon - lightning and time-aligned dragons, with a paralyzing lightning breath - aside from the wing flap,
they can spit a ball of lightning (a projectile that can potentially knock back and damage bones and internal organs),
a blob of liquid lightning which can cause paralysis, and also cast a Torpor spell which decreases speed and agility.

Blue Dragon - frost and magic-aligned dragons, with a frost breath that causes blisters and slowing down. 
They are capable of a wing flap, and also a similar syndrome-inducing liquid glob and solid, strong projectile as their bronze cousins.
On top of that, they have three magical abilities - a slow spell which decreases speed and agility, Polymorph which 
has a chance of transforming a victim into a sheep, and also a single fireball throw.

Green Dragon - nature-aligned dragons. They have an acid breath that causes major bleeding and blistering.
They are also capable of two spells - Sleep, which can induce drowsiness, and Accelerate Decay, which causes severe necrosis and dizziness.

Black Dragon - earth-aligned dragons. They have a potent magma breath, and can occasionally breathe a stream of fire.
Additonally they can also use an earth-shatter attack which sends rocks at up to 2 targets, and also an undirected
flame wave attack.

Drakeadon - two-headed, wingless, animalistic dragons. They lack the magical abilities of the other dragons, but also possess
the breath attacks of all other dragons - they also have the same Blast Wave of the black dragons, as well as their earth shatter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Giants
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magma Giant - a giant of magma and molten crust. Not as durable as bronze colossi - however, they possess a magma breath and a fire jet
attack.

Gronn - cyclopean, brutish giants. They possess three unique attacks - a boulder toss, which can potentially do a lot of internal damage,
a ground slam which releases a wave of dust that knocks creatures around, and a shout that can cause dizziness. They have expert fighter and striker skills,
but are only adequate in dodging.

Magnaron - a tougher, fire-immune variant of the Gronn, over three times as large. They are more resistant to damage due to having a layer of stone over most of their body.
They have similar attacks as the Gronn - their boulder toss can hit up to three targets. In addition they also have a Pulse attack that can cause pain and dizziness.
They have accomplished striker and fighter skills, and are skilled at dodging.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prime Sha - as with the Titanic Watchers, they are technically different castes of the same creature, and as such not every type may appear in the same world.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All Prime Sha have similar body plans - having 6 eyes, four legs (which they don't actually need in order to walk) - the main difference being the amount of their back spikes, wheter
they have tusks or mandibles, and the amount of horns - all are capable of throwing shadow bolts at up to 4 targets.
All of the Sha's unique abilities can cause a creature to cough, potentially spreading the Sha's influence to other nearby friendly creatures.

Sha of Hatred - can raise dead as powerful, agile zombies that can spit black sludge - the sludge can cause an affected creature to turn hostile to everything around it. 
Can additionally Instill Hatred, which makes a creature more violent and fearless, potentially throwing itself into a dangerous situation, 
and has a low chance of simply making it hostile to everything around it.

Sha of Anger - can breathe a cloud of shadowflame, potentially causing burns - can also Intensify Anger, which can potentially make a creature hostile and more violent.

Sha of Pride - can shoot a blast of negative energy at a target, causing the creature to potentially become overconfident and hostile - can also cast a Mark of Arrogance, which has a similar effect.

Sha of Violence - can enrage, increasing its strength and agility and making it more prone to rage. Can also Instill Violence in other creatures, making them more violent and anger-prone.

Sha of Fear - can breathe shadow and use Terrify, both of which can cause a creature to run away in fear.

Sha of Despair - can use Whirl of Shadow, which is an undirected flow of darkness - potentially causes a creature to be more prone to depression. Can also use Crippling Despair which has a similar effect.

Sha of Doubt - can use Breath of Doubt which is a flow of shadow that can cause a creature to be more prone to anxiety and stress - can also use Gnawing Doubt, which has a similar effect.
