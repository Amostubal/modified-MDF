Short and sweet:
-Pet spiders claim nest boxes,
-Spider egg shells are made of SILK,
-The new SILK_REEL building costs 1 build material + 1 mechanism,
-At the SILK_REEL eggs made of silk are automatically turned into 3 silk thread each,
-This is done by a WEAVER.

I also added a new domestic 'tunnel tarantula', feel free to remove it.
