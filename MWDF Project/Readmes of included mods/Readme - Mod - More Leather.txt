Instead of 1 leather per creature, you get leather based on the creatures size.

Larger creatures give several pieces, while small creatures might not even give one. They skins are not useless however, because several small skins can be connected to make one tanned hide. Your tanner will do this automatically.

For reference:
Kitten: 0.33 tanned hides.
Dog: 1 tanned hide.
Horse: 3 tanned hides.

This should give you a general idea.

This works both for leathers as well as parchments.
