                <p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p>

                <h1 align="left">General Info</h1>
                <p align="left"><strong>Skills:</strong> All skills are the same as vanilla DF. There is nothing new to learn here.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Combat: </strong>Nothing has changed. If you want melee, ranged or traps, thats still your choice to make.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Weapons:</strong> In addition to all vanilla weapons, you can also make powerful great-weapon, only wielded with two hands. A javelin thrower makes a better crossbow, and there are a few more weapons like pikes and halberds available now.</p>
                <p align="left">All weapons can be improved in the weaponry.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Ammo:</strong> Besides vanilla ammo, you can now make broadhead, hammerhead and piercing ammo. These work like slashing damage, blunt damage and piercing damage.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Armor:</strong> Besides vanilla armor, you have access to plate armor, which is slightly better but costs you more bars.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Materials:</strong> In addition to vanilla materials you have access to tanned skins like upgrade scale, chitin and shell, higher metals like titanium, wolfram, cobalt, higher alloys like mithril or volcanic. The best is still the delicious blue candy deep underground.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Pets:</strong> All vanilla pets are still there. In addition you got some more dwarfy alternatives: Shaggy badgerdogs, rock-crabs, leatherwing-bats that can be shorn for leather, bearded cavernkeets, birds that have shearable beards and more... </p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Food:</strong> No changes here.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Drink:</strong> Alcohol is just as important as ever.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Digging:</strong> Mining has not  changed much. But some shallow rock types and rubble patches only leave dust when mined, which forces you to dig deeper for real rock. Fossils, relics and treasure can be dug up from ruins, your archeologist can identify and restore them. You can also stumble upon the Gems of Armok, which have special effects tied to them, like water/magma generation.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong> Your embark selection is pretty much the same as in vanilla. You don't necessarily need an anvil, because you can make them from ore in the smelter, but otherwise everything is the same. Some more pets, some more metals, but nothing that stands out.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Nobles:</strong> All vanilla nobles are still there. </p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Magic: </strong>No real magic for the dwarves, but they can cover their weapons with runes for a slight buff.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Tech:</strong> Most dwarven tech is centered around metalworking and forging, so it would be best to focus on mining and getting access to magma. This will help seeing their best side. :)</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Castes: </strong>Guilds and Military groups. These learn their fitting skills at a 200% rate, the military group members are also a bit more sturdy in combat. You can join guilds/groups in the guildhouse or garrison workshops for 2500 gold coins.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Important stuff:</strong> Besides 'Temperature: On', I honestly cant think of anything that needs to play. Only the metallurgist comes to mind, because all alloy-making reactions have been moved there. Otherwise all vanilla DF rules apply, but there is nothing that MasterworkDF forces you to do to survive. </p>
                <p align="left">Just keep in mind that vanilla DF has <strong>one</strong> invader race, Goblins. MasterworkDF has <strong>sixteen</strong>. This means up a lot more !FUN!,snatcher, thieves, sieges and ambushes. Again, these are optional. You can even add another <strong>fifteen </strong>fortress defence races to it.</p>
