        <p><strong>Before you embark:</strong> Getting a good embark spot is more important for kobolds than for other races. A cave will allow quick access to the underground. A forested area will help, giving you access to much needed wood for your tents. Since kobolds dont eat plants, farming isnt that important and very cold or hot biomes are perfectly fine. </p>
        <p>I would recommend embarking with plenty of lifestock, jack rats most of all. Without leather you cant build tents, and kobolds need to eat meat.</p>
<p><strong>After the embark:</strong>  Important in the beginning is to prepare some kind of defense, be it a moat, wall or traps. Kobolds cant fight well and you will surely fall if you dont hide the first few fights. </p>
<p>Hunting and farming animals will give you the access to most materials you need. Kobolds very much rely on organic materials, like leather meat and bone for their buildings, weapons and armors. Poisoned ranged weapons and  pets should be a good defense. Little huts with basements is the design I usually choose for my camps, with the workshops on the surface in the open.</p>
<p>A breeding warren helps female kobolds to give offspring, which comes of age in only 1 year. This will help you populate your fort quickly. </p>
<p><strong>Late-Game:</strong> Kobolds are a low-tech race, so they max out quickly. Keeping them alive is the hard part.</p>
<p align="center">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Skills:</strong> Kobolds have natural skills in  dodging. The most important skills in camp life is leatherworking.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Combat: </strong>Kobolds are tiny and weak, and should rely on ranged weapons and traps. Melee combat is mostly done by your pets or in vastly superior numbers.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Weapons:</strong> Most weapons are too big for kobolds, so you have make your own, weak ones.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Ammo:</strong> You have cheap poisoned ammo at the start, use it. Poison your blowdarts in your still.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Armor:</strong> Kobold armor is slightly inferior to those of other races. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Materials:</strong> The main building material is leather, you need wood for fuel, different sorts of leather for armor. Fire-safe blocks should be made from bone. Clay is unlimited, but needs fuel.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Pets:</strong> Kobolds use shalswars to hunt vermin,  spiders for silk-farms, scorpions to fight, and Jack rats are the main food source, giving birth to 3-5 babies.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Food:</strong> Kobolds need meat. They wont eat plants, so farm-plots are only for extra-ingredients, main food source is animal farming, fishing and hunting.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Drink:</strong> Alcohol makes kobolds dizzy. Drink water instead.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Digging:</strong> Kobolds can not dig.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong> You should take many, many jack-rats with you, for meat, leather and bones. Embark on a cave to have access to the caverns, which is really important for you. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Nobles:</strong> The nobles are exactly the same as in dwarf mode, just with different names. Hammerer uses a whip.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Magic: </strong>You can control the weather through rain-dances. Important to put out fires.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Tech:</strong> Highest-tech kobolds have is some more interesting traps parts. That's it.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Caste System:</strong> Kobolds come in twelve types. Simple changes, so dont worry about it. Viper, Badger and Lizard are good for combat though.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Important stuff:</strong> Cave-Embarks, poisons, leather, leather, leather.</p></td>
