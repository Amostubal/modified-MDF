                <p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p>

                <h1 align="left">General Info</h1>
                <p align="left"><strong>Skills:</strong> Your hermit can learn any skill in the game, just like a normal dwarf. He starts with 0 skill points, making the start somewhat harder.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Combat: </strong>You will want to stay out of combat if possible. You are alone and no one will come to help you, when you are unconscious and bleeding out. </p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Weapons:</strong> You favor the bow, both as hunting weapon and in war. It allows you to keep your distance. Otherwise you have axes, swords, hammers and spears. Choose the right weapon for the right opponent.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Ammo:</strong> Arrows. You can poison them for even more uses. Paralyzing poisons are the best.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Armor:</strong> Normal leather or metal armor. Get as much as you can, layers over layers. </p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Materials:</strong> Normal materials, nothing new.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Pets:</strong> You can take any pet that the dwarf civilization has access to. </p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Food:</strong> Should be easy, since you only have one person to feed. Hunt, fish, butcher, farm, gather... as you like.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Drink:</strong> Only dwarves are alcohol-dependent, if you play a hermit of a different race, water is perfectly fine.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Digging:</strong> Same as dwarves, please bring a pick at embark.Otherwise you have to wait till invaders come, kill some, melt their gear and forge your own pick.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong> Same as always, although water-access is fairly important for the hermit.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Nobles:</strong> You got one noble, and that is you. He does all jobs, although he will never use the justice or healthcare system. But you can use the bookkeeper, broker, manager, militia commander and diplomat. Its all in one. Due to a bug in DF I had to add militia captain and sheriff as well, since these are mutually exclusive. Your hermit will end up being all three, as you like.                </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Religion: </strong>You can build a house shrine and pray, spawning items that are needed for moods. It's not really important, since almost no hermits can craft artefacts; except if you play as one of the main races like dwarves, humans, kobolds, orcs or succubi.</p></td>
