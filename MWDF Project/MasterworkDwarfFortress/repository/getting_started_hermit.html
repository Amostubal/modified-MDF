        <p><strong>Before you embark:</strong> Since this is a challenge mode intended for experienced players, there is not much to say. You can take as many items as you like, making it harder or easier for your start.</p>
        <p><strong>After the embark:</strong> At the beginning the game will look like normal dwarf mode.  The only change is one new workshop, !Start Hermit Mode!, build it and run the reaction to start playing properly, kill the dwarves and select your hermit.</p>
        <p>Since you play as a single person, security is important more than ever, so get a pick and build your home quickly. </p>
<p><strong>Late-Game:</strong> Thats all yours. Dig to hell, open a tavern for mercs and bards, rob caravans, be a loner in a forest, or create the most amazing masterpiece gear of all times, for your adventurer to find. </p>
