        <p>You have access to all dwarf-civ workshops as well as a special building which starts the hermit mode; literally named &quot;!!! Start Hermit Mode!!!&quot;.</p>
        <p>To use it, build it at the beginning, it will have one reaction: Start Hermit Mode. When you run it, you will be able to select your race from 200 types and your gender. The reaction will then spawn your hermit, kill the dwarves and gives a small introduction into the story. It also spawns 7 coffins to get rid of the dwarves quickly.</p>
        <p>The workshop will get a second use now: You can pick your starting gear if you like. If not, please raze the building.</p>
        <p>For information on the normal workshops you can use, please see the dwarf-workshop section.</p>

          <p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
          <p><br />
            - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
          <p><br />
            - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
          <p><br />
            - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
          <p><br />
            - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
          <p><br />
            - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
          <p><br />
            - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p>
